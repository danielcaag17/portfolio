        <>
        This project is part of a Bachelor's Thesis and consists of a platform{" "}
        developed with <strong>Django</strong> that allows users to{" "}
        <strong>upload videos via a web interface</strong> and receive them back{" "}
        with <strong>bounding boxes</strong> highlighting the detected people in{" "}
        each frame. Its modular architecture allows for future expansions to{" "}
        other detection types. It includes <strong>AWS S3</strong> cloud storage
        integration, and is divided into two Django apps: one for backend logic
        and another for the web interface.

        Microservice built with <strong>FastAPI</strong> that processes{" "}
        <strong>videos hosted on Amazon S3</strong> using own object detection{" "}
        models developed from the infrastrucutre of YOLO. The system generates
        an annotated version of the video with detected objects, which is
        reuploaded to S3. The API response includes both the original and
        processed video URLs, along with metadata about the detections (classes,
        counts, timestamps, etc.). It is part of a larger video analysis system
        focused on person detection.

        This backend was developed for the <strong>Airmon</strong> project, part{" "}

        is intended to run on Linux environments (Ubuntu 22.04). The environment{" "}
        is managed using <code>venv</code> and <code>pip</code>. Although it is{" "}
        an academic project, its structure and setup make it easily extendable{" "}
        to production environments.
